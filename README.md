First, it’s duh-LOO-kee. Just like zucchini or Pinocchio.

## A little guide to who I am and how I work

### I love to write things down

I have ADHDI (inattentive ADHD), so I forget things easily. It helps me a lot to have everything in writing, but it turns out, neurotypicals benefit from this too! I might jot down notes while you’re talking to me, or send email reminders with what we discussed/decided. This is not a binding agreement - it’s just to try to keep me on the same page.

### I love calendar

Having dedicated time for heads-down work is great, and I try to make specific blocks on my calendar for this. If it’s not blocked off, swing by my office, or put a VC on my calendar.

### I’m non-binary

Specifically, I identify as agender. My preferred pronouns are she/they. I’m totally fine with "she/her" usage - for me, pronouns aren’t a big deal - but I don’t like being referred to as "lady", "ma'am", "miss", or "a woman".
